      <h1>LA Contracts Bot (Prototype)</h1>

      <h2>What it was supposed to be</h2>
      <p>
        A small bot that could scan public contract data from Los Angeles and flag anything that looked unusual. Not a full investigation, just a quiet background process that noticed patterns the city preferred to ignore. Los Angeles has a long record of treating corruption as a civic rhythm. The council has an equally long record of participating in scandals with city contractors. The Huizar case was only one example. The goal was to make a system that could watch the details without getting pulled into the noise.
      </p>

      <h2>What exists instead</h2>
      <p>
        One official document. A collection of fifty public records requests sent to the City Council and to the Office of the City Controller. A paper trail of unanswered emails, broken portals, and delayed responses. A set of scripts that almost run. A folder called
        <span class="code-block">data_raw</span>
        that never filled the way it was supposed to. A five year crashout that became part of the project whether I wanted it or not.
      </p>

      <div class="code-block">
python run_anomaly_detector.py \
  --input data_raw/contracts_sample.csv \
  --output reports/anomalies.csv
      </div>

      <p>
        The command looks convincing. The data does not exist yet.
      </p>

      <h2>Why it stalled</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>The city transparency infrastructure is built to slow you down.</li>
        <li>Public records requests took more energy than the actual code.</li>
        <li>The bureaucracy had more stamina than I did.</li>
        <li>The story kept expanding and the data never arrived at the pace the project needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What this fragment reveals</h2>
      <p>
        That corruption in Los Angeles is not a secret or an exception. It is a structural habit that shapes how information moves. That building a bot to track anomalies requires the very data the city makes difficult to access. That sometimes a project exposes its subject by failing. The museum keeps this prototype because the failure is part of the truth. It documents an attempt to follow the money in a place where the pathways are designed to blur. It also shows the limits of one person trying to build clarity inside a system that is not interested in being seen.
